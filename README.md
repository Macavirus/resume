# My Resume

This directory contains my resume in Emacs Org Mode format.

I maintain my resume in org-mode to make it trivial to export to HTML,
LaTeX, Markdown, and PDF formats.

## Manpage Foramt

Just for fun, my resume is also availble in manpage format using `groff`.
Just type:

    man ./resume.man

on any system with manpage support to read it.
